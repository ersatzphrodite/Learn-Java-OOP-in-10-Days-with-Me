**Learn Java OOP in 10 Days with Me**

I royally messed up by getting delayed by a year, so now I have to deal with the curriculum change (EVERYTHING IS JAVA; my Introduction to Programming course was taught in Python), and now, I have about less than two weeks to actually learn it from scratch before the midterm. Let's get goin'!
